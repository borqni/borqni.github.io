                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has
                        become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest
                        of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top
                        fashion magazines. Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.

                        Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential
                        across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance,
                        auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has
                        appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how
                        robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her
                        reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first
                        United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an
                        official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights
                        and equality.

                        Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and
                        remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology
                        story.

                        Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day
                        renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act
                        amazingly human. After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius
                        machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively
                        human traits must be integrated into the artificial intelligence of these genius machines:
                        Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’
                        genius machines can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves.
                        Sophia personifies this bold and responsible goal.

                        Please follow Sophia’s journey to observe and engage with her as she develops into an exciting
                        platform for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and service robotics applications in
                        business, medical/healthcare, and education.
